                i like majority of the songs, but some of them are misses. for me, obviously! i think it's 'cause i have such a specific genre that i love, and some of the songs on "heartbreak designer" aren't that for me.

                <br>
                even before the lyrics came out on spotify, just trying to decipher what they were saying, it always felt like i kind of... childhood friends to lovers kind of situation. though i guess in the context of "wayside", it's kind of estranged childhood friends and either failed love or unrequited love. i'm leaning more towards the latter.
                <br><br>
                first, my thoughts on the title, "wayside". i'll be honest, i still think of wayside, the t.v. show, from time to time when i listen to this song. i never knew what "wayside" meant - hell, i didn't even realize it was an actual word. the definition provided by merriam-webster is "the side of or land adjacent to a road or path." immediately, my initial thoughts of the song were confirmed, that the narrator is (still) in love with the love interest, but the love interest is not. this actually made the lyrics, "Take me away from the wayside", more impactful to me. the narrator isn't talking about being stranded on the side of the road, no, that's too literal. the road of path, specifically staying on it, symbolizes that their love is still there, that they both still love each other. now that the narrator is on the wayside, he feels as if he's been thrown to the side. him wanting to get away from the wayside, most likely back on the road, is him wanting the love to rekindle. 
                <br><br>
                actually, merriam-webster also shows a phrase using "wayside", "by the wayside:. it means "out of consideration" or "into a condition of neglect or disuse". this only furthers my reasoning for believing why the "wayside" is supposed to represent unrequited love.
                <br><br>
                though, i think that might've been obvious.
                <br><br>
                let's talk about why i love this song so much.
                <br><br>
                it... gives me a similar vibe to "roses": it's so good it hurts. "roses", in regards to its lyrics, still hurts more than this song, and the build up for "roses" hits a lot more than "wayside". still, i think "wayside" emulates that same kind of build up.
                <br><br>
                i love how it goes into jordan's verse after the last chorus of the song. the way the drums and guitars cut off to allow for the almost emptiness of jordan's verse (in a good way, of course) makes me feel so... hollow inside. the best way i can describe it is when you're feeling really intense emotions, whether you're screaming in anger or sobbing uncontrollably, and then suddenly, you feel nothing. i guess the best way i can put it is that jordan's verse sends a chill down my spine. again, in a good way. they basically took that moment, the sudden switch from intense to nothing, and put it into song form.
                <br><br>
                they don't do that in "roses".
                <br><br>
                "roses" keeps building up as the song goes on, to the point where the ending of the song is supposed to be the most intense feeling. i've interpretted it as the moment you finally breakdown.
                <br><br>
                i will admit, the first time listening to "wayside", jordan's verse caught me off guard. as much as i love her voice, i just wasn't sure if i jived with the sudden switch that much. the more i listened to the song, i realized that i actually love it.
                <br><br>
                another way i'll put it is as a transition from the fourth and last stage of grief, that being depression and acceptance respectively. i know that the five stages of grief are not the best in terms of properly defining how people go through grief, but i'm not using it to do that. i'm just showing how this song can be seen as a wave of emotions.
                <br><br>
                i like to believe that everything before jordan's verse, that being the regular verses as well as the chorus, is the bargaining stage. as stated by cruse, a u.k. organization that helps people through difficult times, bargaining is commonly when people start "going over and over things that happened in the past". this is when people "[ask] a lot of 'what if' questions, wishing [they] could go back and change things in the hope things could have turned out differently." this is especially evident in the prechorus and the second verse of the song.
                <br><br>
                funnily enough, the prechorus also has a hint of denial sprinkled in there, "i would like to believe that you're still coming over - that we're still getting closer", but i won't delve much into that. the bargaining hits with the next line, "But that's when we were younger", as the narrator begins reflecting on their relationship in the past. while it's not explicitly mentioned that the narrator is now hoping that he could go back to change things, it is heavily implied. even the use of "but" in that line illustrates that the narrator badly wants to go back to when they were younger, when they were closer. a line in the chorus also helps to imply that narrator's want to go back, "How can I make you call?" this line suggests that the narrator and the love interest used to talk often. using the word "make" for this line also makes it seem like the love interest could have possibly been the one calling the narrator a lot in the past, as the narrator now wants the love interest to start calling them back again. or that the narrator was the one always calling them and now wants the love interest to start calling them.
                <br><br>
                does that make sense?
                <br><br>
                anyway, next couple lines for the whole bargaining aspect of the song is the part where horoscopes are brought up. now, let's be honest for a second... horoscopes are bullshit. horoscopes are, more often than not, too generalized, as it helps make them seem more believable and helps people relate to them more. i'm sure in "wayside", the narrator doesn't actually believe in horoscopes, and he is instead using them as an excuse. now that might be obvious with the line "we'll blame it on the stars", but that could also come from someone who genuinely believes in horoscopes. surely you've heard at least one person say something like, "ooh, that's so virgo of you". anyway, my point is that the narrator feels like he's reaching for excuses, reaching for a reason why him and the love interest didn't work out. i know i've heard some people say stuff along the lines of, "oh, we didn't work out because he hates blue and i like blue", knowing there must've been something else going on.
                <br><br>
                now, jordan's verse. again. it's the empty, depressing feeling. there's barely anything happening during it, but it slowly begins building up. it doesn't build up to how intense it was before jordan's verse, kind of a middle ground actually. i think this is perfect for the slow feeling of acceptance. for the narrator, it's accepting that the love interest wants nothing to do with him anymore, that he knows he's at fault. he knows he can't blame the stars for something he did, that he can't beg for the love interest back anymore.
                <br><br>
                whether the narrator actually feels remorse for whatever he did is up in the air, and i personally don't have an opinion on it. 
                <br><br>
                i would like to say that based off the next song in the album, "better than you", he either isn't remorseful, or he was at first then got into a fight with love interest.
                <br><br>
                wait, i said i thought that, in my opinion, this was about estranged childhood friends + unrequited love. i never really went that in depth into why i thought that. well, i'll make it brief.
                <br><br>
                it feels like narrator has been in love with love interest for a while, and that he thought that love interest returned those feelings. that's where the line "Tell me that I'm wrong - That you never felt that way". this along with the line from the prechorus, "But that's when we were younger", just... hurts. people probably interpreted this as possibly high school lovers, maybe even college, and the current them is when they're adults, but i think the thought of the narrator and love interest being childhood friends makes this even more devastating. 
                <br><br>
                the line, "That's what we were told", is my main reason for thinking this is about childhoods friends. it's the image of them being childhood friends because their parents knew each other, and they were told that they would be getting closer the older they got, that they would still be hanging out. but the current them aren't getting closer at all. they're actually drifting further and further apart.
                <br><br>
                so now the narrator feels like he's been lied to. not in the sense of: "i deserve this". it's more the sense of: "i was looking forward to it.
                <br><br>
                anyway, that's my thoughts on "wayside". one of my favourite new songs on the album.
