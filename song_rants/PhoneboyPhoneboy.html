                The overall meaning/purpose of "Phoneboy": It isn't just a name
            </h>
            <p class="text-small">
                When I first discovered Phoneboy, I assumed that their first album, "Phoneboy", was merely a collection of songs. I didn't think it was like their next album, "Moving Out", where its songs contributed to an overall theme (being the idea of growing up and experiencing the adult world when you don't feel ready for it). All I ever thought about "Phoneboy" as an album was that I liked the overall sound of the music more than "Moving Out", nothing more. It wasn't until literally a couple weeks ago (currently May 7th, 2025 writing this) that something hit me.
